approach for histogram transformation:

- Each feature recorder keeps track of the histogram defs.
  - needs local vector of the defs?
  - or a pointer to the def?
- feature recorder asked to produce its histograms
- histograms can be produced in memory or at close.

Then:
- in-memory histogram needs to create a different in-memory for each def.
